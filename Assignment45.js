// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always
//  receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
//  Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an 
// optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
