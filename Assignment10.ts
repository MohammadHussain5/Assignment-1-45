// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each.
//  If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing
//  what the program does.


// Define my first name and last name

let firstName = "Mohammad";
let lastName = "Hussain";

// Add my first name and last name in full name

let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

// Print my full name

console.log(fullName);
